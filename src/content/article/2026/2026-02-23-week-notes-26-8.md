- It's been a very quite week of me painting one me piece of furniture in Baby-En room and waiting for it to dry
- El and me are deep into the TV Show Dark
  - We never watched a Show were we needed to stop so often to talk about what just happened and to loosen some knots in our heads before continuing
  - We were so close to finishing it this week but us being tired made us stop and move the last two episodes to today
- Sunday we went on a nice walk in Estenstadmarka. We got some fresh snow in the last couple of days and the sun was shining, so it was beautiful to walk through the forest. We were also almost by ourselves.
- Next week is Baby-En first birthday
  - Sadly his only friend is not able to join but we invited some friends and colleagues for coffee and cake and booked a place at the dog hotel for Krümel
