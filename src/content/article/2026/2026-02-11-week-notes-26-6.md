- We finished the last James Bond movie on Sunday - Not going to do this any time soon again ...
- The week itself was quite uneventful
    - Went a couple of times in the city with En and my Dad to have some coffee
    - My dad wanted to buy a Norwegian woolen pullover - and he found one
    - He also help us a lot by chopping down the big branches which fell of the tree in the beginning of winter
    - My dad also invited us to dinner at [Mat fra Hagen](https://matfrahagen.no/) (food from the garden) in the city center which was lovely as always :)
- Winter is still very cold but it looks like we are getting some fresh snow next week (finally)
- We finished the second pallete of firewood - it's really time to renew the heat pump in the living room. The current one just cannot keep up against the cold anymore.
