I am trying out a new format: Week Notes!

It might seem a bit weird to start with #3 but this happens when you start the year already busy with life :)

The current format is mostly copied by [Jamie Tanna](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2026/03/) and will most likely evolve with future iterations.

I do like the idea of adding links I found throughout the week, like [Robb Knigh](https://rknight.me/blog/weeknote-1982/) does.

So let's get started:

- Had a quiet and normal week of parental leave with Baby E
    - We are trying to figure his sleep schedule out
    - Currently the days are fine but the nights are annoying
    - On a more fun note: He is getting steadier on his feet every day and starting to try his first steps (while holding on to something, like a box)
- Some Saturday IKEA shopping
- And on Sunday my father informed me that he will come and visit on Thursday for 2,5 weeks :'D - I am quite happy, but I must say, it was a bit of a shock-information

Watched ([trakt.tv](https://app.trakt.tv/profile/niklasfyi)):

- Fear the Walking Dead (finished S4 and started S5)
- One Piece (3 very early episodes)
- The Office (Started S7)
- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

So that was basically my last week. Let's see if I can make a habbit out of it. And don't expect all the features like webmentions and so on to work right away. I am still working on these :)
