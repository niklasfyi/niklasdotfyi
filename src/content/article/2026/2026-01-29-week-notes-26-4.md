Well, it's already thursday and therefore almost time for week #5. So, let's finish #4...

- On monday the indoor fence to baby-proof the fireplace finally arrived. So, now I can let baby E crawl around the living room without watching his every step.
    - Currently, it is constantly so cold, that we have the fireplace burning throughout the whole day
- I visited my collegues in the new office and kept a lot of them from working by bringing the baby. Suddenly everyone needed a long coffee break in the kitchen :)
- My dad arrived on thursday
    - It was way easier with the dog and him, than what I was expecting
- Me and my dad went for Pub Quiz at [Three Lions Pub](https://www.threelions.no/)
    - It was the start of the season and our usual team had so many people joining that we needed to split in two teams
    - We as the extra team made it at least somewhere in the middle
- We also thought about things we want to finish in the house while my dad is here. It's great to have additional help, so someone can take care of baby E while the other is finishing tasks
- It's been a week of watching the old James Bond movies. I am still missing the newest so E and me started watching them from the beginning. It's been tough for E to watch them so she is quite happy that I can watch them with my dad now :D
