I'm on a role here, I like it!

January is already over. 2026 is rushing as fast as 2025 did. But I do plan to write a review of 2025 in the coming days.

- We are almost done with watching all of the James Bond movies - I am quite sure we will finish them next week!
- We bought a new electric heater for Baby-Ens room - and also attached it to the wall almost the same day - I am very proud for that :)
    - We only have to finish paiting the shelf, which El is currently doing, and re-attach the electric sockets
- I had the local NITO (union) general assembly on friday where we elacted the new board, as one of the two board members is leaving the company
- Bought iceskates for my dad and went skating today on the lake right infront of our house. The weather was lovely so we were not alone. My dad fell quite hard on our way back home, so let's hope no major injuries. For now he it seems fine. 
- Made some vegan cinnamon buns today, which turned out quite good :P 

Watched ([trakt.tv](https://app.trakt.tv/profile/niklasfyi)):
