- Spend some time in the city with my dad and Baby-En before he left on Tuesday
    - We actually wanted to go to [Sponhuset](https://sponhuset.no/) but it was closed due to winter vacation
    - Went to [Espresso House](https://no.espressohouse.com/) in [City Lade](https://citylade.no/) instead - Baby-En had a blast because the coffee shop is in the middle of the shopping mall and he can smile at sooo many people :) 
- Went to Carglass so they can fix the stone chip they missed last time
- On Friday we went to the dog park after a long while. I think Krümel had fun. It's sometimes hard to know because she doesn't want to leave but also mostly watches the other dogs play.
- Invited Pat and Dani for Lasange on Saturday, they have just been to Germany and brought us some nice vegan stuff ... yummy. 
- Sunday was a quite day with lots of sun. We went for a nice family walk and enjoyed the rest of the day by doing mostly nothing
