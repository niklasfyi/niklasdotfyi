        Harry Potter has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house
        his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful
        wizard—with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
        and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help
        of the school's kindly headmaster, Harry uncovers the truth about his
        parents' deaths—and about the villain who's to blame.

Baby E is finally able to sleep for long periods of time again, so we could watch a movie. Great ending to our first Christmas as a little family ❤️
