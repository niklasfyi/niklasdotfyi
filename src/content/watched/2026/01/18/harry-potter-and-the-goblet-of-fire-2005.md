        When Harry Potter's name emerges from the Goblet of Fire, he becomes a
        competitor in a grueling battle for glory among three wizarding
        schools—the Triwizard Tournament. But since Harry never submitted his
        name for the Tournament, who did? Now Harry must confront a deadly
        dragon, fierce water demons and an enchanted maze only to find himself
        in the cruel grasp of He Who Must Not Be Named.
