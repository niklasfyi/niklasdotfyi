        When young priest Jud Duplenticy is sent to assist charismatic firebrand
        Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, it’s clear that all is not well in the pews.
        After a sudden and seemingly impossible murder rocks the town, the lack
        of an obvious suspect prompts local police chief Geraldine Scott to join
        forces with renowned detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery that
        defies all logic.

Very amusing movie. Although we were quite certain of who did it from quite early on, it is always great to learn the actual process of the crime.
