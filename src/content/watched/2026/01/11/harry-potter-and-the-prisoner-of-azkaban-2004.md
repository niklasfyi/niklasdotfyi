        Year three at Hogwarts means new fun and challenges as Harry learns the
        delicate art of approaching a Hippogriff, transforming shape-shifting
        Boggarts into hilarity and even turning back time. But the term also
        brings danger: soul-sucking Dementors hover over the school, an ally of
        the accursed He-Who-Cannot-Be-Named lurks within the castle walls, and
        fearsome wizard Sirius Black escapes Azkaban. And Harry will confront
        them all.
