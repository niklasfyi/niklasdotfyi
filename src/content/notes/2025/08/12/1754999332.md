I was looking for a book for years now and I just found it. Now and then I start searching for it, and now I thought I give GPT 5 a run for it. Now that I know its name again, I am wondering why I did not find it before. The info on Amazon about it is basically exactly what I remember of the book ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Btw, it's called "Gel√∂scht" by Marco Kunst (Dutch - translated to German).
